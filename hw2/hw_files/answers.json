  "p1_1": "For the image, I only normalize the pixel values to be between 0 and 1. For the pose, in dataset, I use 7d vector to represent the pose (x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz) in camera frame. Transform the pose from world frame to camera frame is a natural choice for pose estimation as input image is captured in camera frame. In the training, I convert the quaternion to 6d representation then map it to SO(3) rotation matrix using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization since 6D representation is continuous which avoids discontinuity in other representations such as Euler angles.",
  "p2_2": "The loss only measures how well the policy mimics expert actions in the offline training data. Since the demonstrations cannot cover all possible situations, the policy may encounter unseen states during execution and fail to recover, even if the training loss is low.",
  "p2_3": "Sense-plan-act methods require explicit modeling of perception, planning, and control, often relying on known dynamics and kinematics. SPA also could involves training separate modules for perception, planning, and control, which requires careful design and tuning. In contrast, imitation learning is model-free and end-to-end, mapping observations directly to actions. While IL/BC is easier to train structurally, requiring fewer design decisions, it depends heavily on high-quality, diverse demonstrations to avoid issue such as the learned policy encounters states not seen in demonstrations and fails. Simple behavior cloning also tends to generalize poorly to new or out-of-distribution tasks."
